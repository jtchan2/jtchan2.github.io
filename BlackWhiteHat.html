<h3>Bad Visualization Reasons</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses a Donut Chart, Humans have a hard time measuring area</li>
    <li>Title of visualization doesnt explain/ make ambiguous what sport this is for or what is the purpose</li>
    <li>FUll names of players not listed, people unknown to Cricket may not know who these people are</li>
    <li>Color scale/ color usage is terrible, no need for multiple colors </li>
</ul>
